DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECTS:

            1.Document object represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in browser. Window object represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.
         
            2.Document object is loaded inside the window and it is object of the window property. Window object is loaded in the browser and it is the object of the browser.

            3.In Document object, we can access the document from a window using the window.documet. Whereas in the case Window object, we can access the window from the window only using the window.window.

            4.Properties of document object such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window. Properties of window object cannot be accessed by the document object.

            5.The document is part of Browser Object Model and Document Object Model. Window is part of Browser Object Model only.
